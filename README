Favicon-badge adds a badge to the favicon when there is a number between
parentheses. Very handy for twitter.com for example.

favicon_badge.user.js
	Userscript compatible with Google Chrome and probably Firefox' greasemonkey.
	
	1. If there is a <link rel="shortcut icon"> in the head of the document, it
	will be used.
		1.1 If the href-attribute points to the same domain, it will try to set
		    the source of the background-image directly.
		1.2 Otherwise it will try to use the proxy to load the data as a 
		    data-uri.
	2. Otherwise it will create a <link rel="shortcut icon"> and set the src of
	   the background-image to /favicon.ico.
	
	The proxy uses GM_xmlhttpRequest when available to directly download the 
	image. If this GM function is not supported, it will fallback to stock
	xmlhttprequest and do a cross-domain call to proxy.php to let it download
	the image.

proxy.php
	Proxy for cross-domain xmlhttprequest call.

test.html
	Old test mostly for the drawing of the badge part. Still has some old hacks
	in it.

test-2.html
	Test to test the script for cross-domain favicons. For example twitter, 
	which hosts it's favicon on a content delivery network.
